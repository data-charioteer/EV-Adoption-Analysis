# EV Adoption & Sales Analysis (India)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and sales trends in India** using **national-level aggregated data**.  
The objective is to study overall EV growth, identify dominant vehicle categories, analyze adoption momentum, and evaluate year-on-year (YoY) sales growth.

The analysis uses **SQL for data cleaning and analysis** and **Python for visualization and insights**.

## Visualizations
Final visualizations created using Python:
- Year-wise EV Sales Trend  
- Category-wise EV Sales  
- Category-wise Growth Over Time  
- EV Penetration Trend  
- YoY EV Sales Growth

## Key Insights
- EV sales in India show a consistent upward trend, indicating growing adoption.  
- Two-wheelers and three-wheelers dominate EV sales due to affordability and urban suitability.  
- YoY EV sales growth is volatile, reflecting early-stage market expansion and policy impact.  
- EV penetration has steadily increased, suggesting improving market acceptance.
